🔍 Key Business Insights
1️⃣ Support Calls Are a Strong Churn Driver

Customers with three or more support calls exhibit significantly higher churn rates

Indicates unresolved service issues or poor customer experience

Represents an opportunity for proactive escalation and service recovery



2️⃣ Early-Stage Customers Are Highest Risk

Churn is most concentrated within the first six months of customer tenure

Retention improves and stabilizes as tenure increases

Highlights the importance of onboarding and early engagement



3️⃣ Long-Tenure Customers Show Strong Loyalty

Customers with 24+ months of tenure demonstrate consistently low churn

Contract commitments and loyalty incentives appear effective



📐 Statistical Modeling (SAS)

A logistic regression model was developed in SAS to estimate the probability of customer churn.

Key Predictors:

Customer tenure

Monthly charges

Number of support calls



Contract type (monthly vs. annual)

Model Insights:

Customers with shorter tenure have a higher probability of churn

Frequent support interactions significantly increase churn risk

Monthly contract customers churn at higher rates than annual-plan customers

Premium customers demonstrate stronger retention

This model supports early identification of at-risk customers and proactive retention planning.



💡 Business Recommendations

Based on analytical findings and model results:

Implement early-warning churn flags for customers with multiple support calls

Improve onboarding and engagement within the first 90 days

Encourage annual contract upgrades through targeted incentives

Introduce retention offers before customers reach the six-month risk window

Track support resolution time as a core retention KPI



🎯 Business Impact

This analysis provides leadership with:

Clear identification of churn drivers

Actionable insights for retention strategy

A scalable framework for churn monitoring and prevention
