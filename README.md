Churn-Analysis



Model Insights (SAS Logistic Regression)

Using a logistic regression model built in SAS, key drivers of customer churn were identified. Customers with shorter tenure and higher numbers of support calls showed significantly higher churn risk. Additionally, customers on monthly contracts were more likely to churn compared to those on annual plans, while premium subscribers demonstrated stronger retention.


Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis and modeling results, the following retention strategies are recommended:

Proactively engage customers after multiple support interactions to address unresolved issues.

Encourage annual contract upgrades through targeted incentives to reduce churn risk.

Improve early-stage onboarding to strengthen engagement within the first six months.

Offer loyalty rewards to long-tenure and premium customers to increase lifetime value.
